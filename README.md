## Synopsis
Tool used to clone all data from [thegrid.io](https://thegrid.io/) generated website. It can be used for recursive cloning of almost any HTTP web.

## Motivation
Thegrid.io offers hosting services, but unfortunately does not support HTTPS. I believe that everything should be accessible only via HTTPS, so I wrote this tool to download my thegrid.io generated website to my webhosting.
